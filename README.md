A tool to understand XOR better
===================
Why?
----------------
I was reading about the bitwise XOR and I found myself wondering what the effects of it would be on numbers in other bases, so I made this tool to help look at how numbers act with it.
What is each file?
----------------

xorTools.py provides all the mathematical backend that we'll be needing (finding the XOR given two decimal or binary numbers)

xorAnalyze.py generates a XOR table with user-specified dimensions

TODO:
-----------------------
1. Get a better way to store the data from xoranalysis.py
2. Create a tool to look at the XOR of two numbers visually by looking at the binary and being able to change each value. 
3. keep thinking about whether there's a better way to structure the programs
4. find a better way to visualize the data, i.e. 3d graph with z = xor(x,y)
