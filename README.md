A tool to understand xor better
===================
Why?
----------------
I was reading about the bitwise xor and I found myself wondering what the effects of it would be on numbers in other bases, so I made this tool to help look at how numbers act with the binary xor. (Currently only works for numbers in base 10)

TODO:
-----------------------
1. Get a better way to store the data from xoranalysis.py
2. Add functionality to do the same thing for other bases
3. keep thinking about whether there's a better way to structure the programs
