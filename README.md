A tool to understand xor better
===================
Why?
----------------
I was reading about the bitwise xor and I found myself wondering what the effects of it would be on numbers in other bases, so I made this tool to help look at how numbers act with the binary xor. (Currently only works for numbers in base 10, although xorTools has methods to deal with hex numbers)

TODO:
-----------------------
1. Get a better way to store the data from xoranalysis.py
2. Add functionality to do the same thing for other bases (is this neccessary? examine simpler math and the decimal/binary relationship to see whether you can extrapolate a relationship in other bases)
3. keep thinking about whether there's a better way to structure the programs
4. find a better way to visualize the data, i.e. 3d graph with z = xor(x,y)
